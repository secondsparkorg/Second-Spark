            <h1> Our Team- Second Spark</h1>
        <p>We are Second Spark, a team of like-minded individuals dedicated to making the world cleaner and more environmentally friendly. Our mission is to educate people about the issue of electronic waste (e-waste) and inspire them to recycle and adopt a mindful approach to electronics.</p>
        <h1>Why We Do This</h1>
        <p>Electronic waste is one of the fastest-growing categories of trash globally. We believe that every step taken towards reducing e-waste is significant. SecondSpark not only raises awareness about the consequences of improper disposal but also offers accessible solutions for everyone.
        </p><br><br>
        <h1>What is E-Waste?</h1>
        <p>Discarded electrical and electronic equipment, which includes cellphones, computers, televisions, lamps, power tools, toys, and household appliances, is known as electronic waste material, or e-waste. Old and used electronics that are frequently thrown out when they no longer work properly are referred to as e-waste. With millions of tonnes produced each year this waste stream is one of the fastest-growing problems in the world.</p>

    <h1>Importance of Proper E-Waste Disposal</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Environmental Protection: E-waste contains hazardous materials like lead and mercury, which can contaminate soil and water if not disposed of properly, harming ecosystems and wildlife.
        </li><br>
        <li> Resource Conservation: Electronic devices contain valuable materials such as gold and copper. Recycling e-waste allows these resources to be recovered and reused, reducing the need for new materials.
        </li><br>
        <li>Health and Safety: Improper disposal can release toxic substances into the air and environment, posing health risks to communities. Responsible recycling protects public health.
        </li><br>
        <li>Supporting the Circular Economy: Proper disposal promotes a circular economy by reusing materials, reducing waste, and creating jobs in the recycling sector.
        </li><br>
        <li>Legal Compliance: Many countries have regulations for e-waste disposal. Following these laws helps avoid penalties and encourages environmental responsibility.
        </li><br>
    </ul>
